I've created this compendium due to a lack of good materials for learning the necessary theory. Existing algorithms lists were based mostly on C++ and Pascal. On top of that, the code examples were stripped of comments and using illegible variable names (such as i/j/k). My implementations should help you learn! :)    

The PDF along with its Word source is available on [my Github](https://github.com/asdfMaciej/algorytmy-z-informatyki). If you see a mistake or want to improve the document, feel free to create an Issue or a Pull Request! I'll attach the current version below as well.

I'll mention that I've found a open-source project with [materials for the IT Matura exam](https://github.com/wernexnrs/MATURA-INFORMATYKA) - it may come in handy too. Good luck with your studies!
