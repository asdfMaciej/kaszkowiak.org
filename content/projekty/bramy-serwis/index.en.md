I have been responsible for the maintenance and development of BRAMY-SERWIS' websites for the past three years.

I maintain the websites [bramy-serwis.pl](https://bramy-serwis.pl) and [naprawa-sterownikow.com.pl](https://naprawa-sterownikow.com.pl).
I have also designed and developed the [szybkarolka.pl](https://szybkarolka.pl) website. 

### System for creating reports from technical inspections
I implemented a project that saved hundreds of man-hours for staff - by systematising, speeding up and simplifying the creation of reports.

Originally, each audit report was created manually. This was a tedious, time-consuming task - it took up to several hours per audit. The system has solved this problem, reducing the creation time by several times and making the process much easier. To date, it has saved at least several hundred man-hours.

Based on existing audit reports and existing data in the system, I have created a normalized database model. Based on it, I created a backend in the form of an API and several static pages for navigation. The frontend took the form of a Single Page Application, using Vue. Ultimately, a report is sent to the server in JSON format, which is processed and saved to the database. A PDF file is then generated and made available to the user.

Unfortunately, due to the confidentiality of the system, I cannot post screenshots or a detailed description.
