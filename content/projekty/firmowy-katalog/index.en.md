I designed and implemented a high-speed gate buying and selling center. With this, I strengthened the company's position in the market, expanded its image and created a platform for customers.

The website is available at [szybkarolka.pl](https://szybkarolka.pl). It's optimized, positioned in Google under relevant keywords, and based on a custom graphic design.

## Development process

I started the work by creating a graphic design. I choose Wordpress as a backend because of its simplicity in administration, large collection of plugins, and regular updates. I chose a plugin for displaying the product catalog, and then heavily modified its appearance and functionality. I made it responsive, designed the product and catalog pages, added an API for integration with bramy-serwis.pl, created special fields, and many others. Then I took care of SEO and wrote a plugin that displays correct metadata - e.g. link preview, additional search engine information, product pages, FAQs (Open Schema, JSON-LD). I used Google Analytics to monitor and analyze site traffic.

In order to improve user experience, I optimized the website. I removed all unused resources (embedded JS/CSS scripts, fonts) with the help of DevTools analysis. I cropped images to maintain both loading speed and image quality. I used lazy-loading for images and YouTube videos. I used a plugin to minify the page code to reduce the number and size of queries. I also added a server-side cache.

All of the above methods greatly sped up the loading and performance of the site, improving the user experience, and the search engine ranking.
