I will design and create a fast, mobile-friendly website from scratch. I can help with the domain, hosting, and email setup. I will also provide a SSL padlock on the search bar and improve the site's Google position.

I will individually tailor a website to your business to help you reach more customers.    
I use the latest standards and tools when creating your site, so your site will be easy to maintain.    

Once we talk, I will be able to determine the optimal website type and the number of pages. No preexisting technical knowledge is required, as I will explain the pros and cons of each detail.

I can also create a website from an existing graphic design.

If you are interested, [contact me](/en/contact/). I will be happy to answer all your questions, help work out the details and give a quote.

I have provided a selection of [my completed projects](/en/projects/) with photos and a description. I have also wrote a [technical summary of my skills](/en/about-me/).

I can also undertake the implementation of more complex systems, used to manage a company or its resources. If you have an idea that might improve your business, let's [get in touch](/en/contact/). Your time will not be wasted - if the scope of the project turns out to be beyond my time or skills, I will inform you before starting the job.
