# I will create a tailored website at a favourable price.

I will design and create a website from scratch - fast and mobile friendly. I can help with the domain, hosting, and email setup. I will also provide a SSL padlock on the bar and improve the site's Google position.

Potential customers are almost always looking for information about your business on Google.     
It is only up to you whether they find the information on your website or whether they give up and go to your competitors. 

Each website is an investment with a certain purpose:
- a company website builds your image, increases your credibility and attracts potential customers;
- a personal website presents a portfolio, encourages collaboration and provides contact details;
- a blog documents your business, keeps you in touch with your customers and enables you to share new information.

I will individually tailor a website to your business to help you reach more customers.    
I use the latest standards and tools when creating your site, so your site will be easy to maintain.    

Once we talk, I will help determine the optimal type of site and number of pages. No preexisting technical knowledge is required - I will explain the pros and cons of each detail.    
<!--TODO: I have also written an article explaining [the differences between a dynamic and a static website](/blog/dynamic-a-static-page/).-->     

I have provided a selection of [my completed projects](/en/projects/) with photos and a description of the works. I have also wrote a [technical summary of my abilities](/en/about-me/).

If you are interested, [contact me](/en/contact/) - I answer daily within 24 hours. I can also arrange a phone call or a meeting. I will be happy to answer all your questions, help you work out the details and give a quote.

I will also undertake the implementation of more complex systems, used to manage a company or its resources. If you have an idea that might improve your business, let's [get in touch](/en/contact/). Your time will not be wasted - if the scope of the project turns out to be beyond my time or skills, I will inform you before starting the job.
