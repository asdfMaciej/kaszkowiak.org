I am ready to turn your idea into reality.

I can create a web-based application for managing a company or its resources. It can help improve business processes, therefore saving employees' valuable time. I create applications with an emphasis on security.

I can also undertake a smaller project. Due to a [broad skillset](/en/about-me/) I can also develop an Android app, write a desktop script for task automation, and create a simple device based on Arduino among others. 

If you have an idea, let's [get in touch](/en/contact/). Your time will not be wasted - if the scope of the project turns out to be beyond my time or skills, I will inform you before starting work.
