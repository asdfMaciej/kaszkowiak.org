# I will turn a finished graphic design into a working, functional website. 

I will take care of the speed and search engine positioning. I use the latest technology to ensure the website works well. I will create the website using a CMS, enabling easy content maintenance. I can also help with the configuration of the web server, domain, e-mail, etc.

If you are looking for a developer ready to implement your graphic design, feel free to [contact me](/en/contact/).
