Hey! My name is Maciej Kaszkowiak. I have been programming since I was a child. Currently I specialize in web development.

Currently I am a Computer Science student at the Poznań University of Technology. I live in Poznań and Wronki. I have graduated from a technical school with the best graduate title. I am also a laureate of the 2nd Digital Olympiad.

I love sport, especially road cycling and weight training :) During my free time I also play chess and create open-source projects.

## My experience as a web-developer

I am currently working as a back-end developer at [X-ONE](https://x-one.pl/). In 2021 I was focused on developing a recommender system for Trol Intermedia, primarily as a back-end developer. Since 2018 I have been regularly involved in the maintenance and development of the systems of BRAMY-SERWIS. I did an internship at Komputerpartner (June 2020) and Trol Intermedia (May, July 2019). 

## What do I bring to the table?

I use well-known and proven technologies which reduce website maintenance costs and guarantee good performance. On request, I create websites based on a CMS, allowing the client to edit the content easily on their own.

I can bring a graphic design to life and adapt it for devices of any size - mobile phones, laptops, and desktop computers. I have a good grasp of Photoshop and Figma. Photo editing and simple graphic design isn't an issue for me.

I optimize each website for performance, as a fast, polished website increases visitor interest and search engine ranking. I speed up page loading, ensure SSL works, refine the page preview in Google and on social media, and many others. 

Implementing an advanced project from scratch isn't an issue for me. I use frameworks and proper design patterns - it speeds up the development process and ensures simpler maintenance. I can map the domain model of a company, organization, or a given task - and then create a database that fulfills its role.

## Beyond web development

I can handle Linux server administration for a given project and install the required services, configure them, and keep the server secure. I can collaborate with other developers using a version control system. 

I am also familiar with a range of other technologies. From the top of my head, I can create simple applications for Android. I know Python well, so I can automate various repetitive tasks. I am willing to enter even new, unknown areas.
