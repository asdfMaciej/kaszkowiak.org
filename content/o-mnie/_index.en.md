I have been programming since I was a child. For the past few years I have been specializing in web development. I constantly try to improve by learning and extending my knowledge.

I live in Poznań and Wronki. I have graduated from technical school with a title of the best graduate. I am also a laureate of the 2nd Digital Olympiad. Currently I am studying Computer Science at the Poznań University of Technology.

I love sport, especially road cycling and weight training :) During my free time I also play chess and create open-source projects.

## My experience as a web-developer

I am currently freelancing and working with Trol Intermedia, primarily in the role of a back-end developer. Since 2018 I have been regularly involved in the maintenance and development of the systems of BRAMY-SERWIS. I did an internship at Komputerpartner (June 2020) and Trol Intermedia (May, July 2019). 

## What do I bring to the table?

I use well-known and proven technologies which reduce website maintenance costs and guarantee good performance. On request, I create websites based on a CMS, allowing the client to edit the content easily and on their own.

I can bring a project to life and adapt it for devices of any size - mobile phones, laptops, desktop computers. I am fluent in Photoshop and Figma. I can undertake photo editing and simple graphic design without a hitch.

A fast, polished website increases visitor interest and search engine ranking. I optimise each page for performance and search results. Essentials include: speeding up page loading, ensuring SSL works, refining the page preview in Google and on social media. 

Implementing an advanced project from scratch isn't an issue for me. I use frameworks and proper design patterns - it speeds up the development process and ensures simpler maintenance. I can map the domain model of a company, organization, or a given task - and then create a database that fulfills its role.

## Beyond web development

My Linux server administration knowledge is enough to install required services, configure them, and keep the server secure. I can collaborate with other developers using a version control system. I am also familiar with a range of other technologies (apart from websites). From the top of my head, I can create simple applications for Android. I know Python well, so I can automate various repetitive tasks. I am willing to enter even new, unknown areas.
